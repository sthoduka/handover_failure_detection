## Dependencies
See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)


## Methods
The code for both the video classification and human action segmentation methods are included.

1. Video Classification

We use the implementation of the I3D model from [here](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d). See [pytorch-i3d-trainer/README.md](pytorch-i3d-trainer/) for instructions on how to train and evaluate the different variants mentioned in the paper.


2. Human Action Segmentation

We use the implementation of the MS-TCN model from [here](https://github.com/yabufarha/ms-tcn). See [ms-tcn/README.md](ms-tcn/) for instructions on how to train and evaluate the different variants mentioned in the paper.
